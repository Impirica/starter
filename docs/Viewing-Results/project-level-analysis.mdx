### Key Metrics[​](#key-metrics "Direct link to Key Metrics")

* Safety Rating - *The average percentage of completed tests classified as safe over the selected period. The change shows how this average compares to the previous equivalent period.*

<Note>
  For a 7-day period: If the average Safety Rating for the past 7 days is 85% and it was 80% for the 7 days before that, the change would be shown as "+5% from previous week".
</Note>

* Test Completion Rate - *The average percentage of started tests that were completed over the selected period. The change indicates how this average compares to the previous equivalent period.*

<Note>
  For a 7-day period: If the average Test Completion rate for the past 7 days is 90% and it was 95% for the 7 days before that, the change would be shown as "-5% from previous week".
</Note>

3. Monitor changes in safety ratings over time
4. Identify patterns or shifts in risk levels

### Using Data for Decision Making[​](#using-data-for-decision-making "Direct link to Using Data for Decision Making")

* Implement targeted safety measures based on trends
* Increase testing frequency if needed
* Use insights to inform training programs or policy updates

<Check>
  Regularly review project-level data to identify long-term trends and optimize your safety protocols. This is especially powerful with projects containing many test takers.
