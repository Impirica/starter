If the test taker has a status that remains 'Active' despite believing they had completed it:

* **Technical Issues:** Determine if the test was interrupted.
* **Internet Connectivity:** Ensure the test taker's connection was stable. An internet connection is required throughout the test. There are currently no plans to support offline testing in the future.
* **Retake Test:** Have the test taker complete the assessment again if necessary.
