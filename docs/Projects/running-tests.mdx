<Note>
  Test takers can scan the QR code to access a test in the same way a link is
  clicked. To share this QR code, you can right click it and save the image to
  your computer. This allows you to attach it to emails, text messages, or other
  communications.
</Note>

<Info>
  If a test taker does not receive a confirmation code when they are self
  enrolling for a test, encourage them to check their junk email folder.

### Managing Test Access

- **Active Projects:** Test links are valid when the project is running
- **Inactive Projects:** Test links are disabled when the project is stopped

To pause testing, click "Stop" on the project dashboard. This will temporary lock out test takers from running tests from the test link or scanned QR Code.
