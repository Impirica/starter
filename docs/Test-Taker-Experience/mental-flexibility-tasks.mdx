# Neurapulse Test

Neurapulse tests include tasks designed to measure:

- Reaction time
- Judgment
- Working memory
- Fine motor control
- Mental flexibility

### Task Types

The following tasks have been subject to various forms of validation. Neurapulse tasks are calibrated to real-world driving outcomes, and can predict when a test taker is at risk of driving unsafely. Test takers should perform each task in a safe environment free from distractions.

<Warning>
  If the test taker lifts their finger during a task, a prompt will appear to
  continue. All tasks should be completed as quickly and accurately as possible.
</Warning>

1. **Reaction Time:**

This task measures the test taker's ability to react quickly and accurately to simple stimulus.

<Info>
  Healthy reaction time is the most basic competency tested for measuring risk
  in safety-sensitive environments. It's important for simple tasks that require
  immediate responses. For example, when a driver is on the road, they need to
  be able to respond quickly and accurately to their environment.

- Stage 2: Similar to Stage 1 with but with more dots

2. **Mental Flexibility (Part 1):**

This task measures the test taker's ability to be make judgements quickly and accurately.

<Info>
  Attention-based tasks can be used for measuring a test taker's judgement as
  they excercise their working memory. This ability is important for
  safety-sensitive environments that require sustained focus and attention to
  detail. For example, when a driver plans for a left turn in an intersection,
  they need to accurately judge the flow of traffic.

- Stage 1: Connect numbered dots in the required sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)

- Stage 2: Similar to Stage 1 but with more dots

3. **Mental Flexibility (Part 2):**

This task measures the test taker's mental flexbility while increasing the challenge on their working memory.

<Info>
  Mental flexibility tests are crucial in determining impairment risk. When test
  takers must maintain full attention (keeping a sequence in mind) while
  planning actions, making quick and accurate judgments becomes highly
  challenging. Many safety-sensitive roles involve similar complex, sequential
  tasks where perfect execution is critical for safety.

- Stage 1: Connect dots in the required alternating sequence (1, 25, 2, 26, etc.)
