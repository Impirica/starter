title: "Test Taker Experience"
description: "The entire test experience, from self-enrolling to performing the test, is designed to take under 5 minutes for new test takers to complete. Subsequent tests are much faster to perform, often taking only 1-2 minutes once the test taker has had practice."

After clicking the `Continue` button, a verification code emailed to the test taker.

![Verify Email Copy Number](/images/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/assets/images/email-c56df947599ac5960b5d41362209b4de.png)

This code must be entered to continue.

Next, the test taker selects their dominant hand.

A `Test Audio` button can be pressed (which plays a sound) to ensure audio levels are appropriate.

## Identity Verification[​](#identity-verification "Direct link to Identity Verification")

If face verification is required, the following must be provided:

* a photo id (government issued)
* a live face photo

Using the camera, the photo id should be aligned so that it is fully in view. The photo will be automatically taken.

![Take image of Photo Id](/images/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/assets/images/id-capture-11ff6e33b1bcd471f7239366a25683b5.png)

Next, using the front camera, a selfie will be taken to verify against the photo id.

![Take Photo](/images/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/assets/images/photo-capture-c84531acc98ad94349b61a142d7c1433.png)

Once verification is successful, a timed link is activated. If the test isn't started within the given timeframe or if the verification fails, verification will need to be restarted.

<Check>
  If verification fails, the ambient lighting. The photo id and face must be captured from a well-lit area. If problems persist, glasses and hats may need to be removed.
</Check>

<Note>
  Neurapulse never saves face or photo id information. Once verification is completed the image information is purged.
</Note>

## Task Loading[​](#task-loading "Direct link to Task Loading")

A brief loading screen appears while tasks are downloaded.

<Warning>
  If the test taker is asked to complete another test, the test taker should immediately check their email for a new test link and complete it.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Safety statuses that are calibrated for the individual test taker are *only available to test managers* in the project portal. As data becomes available for an individual test taker, a status is determined from a calculation of risk that may combine objective, relative, and baseline perspectives.
