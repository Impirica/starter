title: "Test Taker Experience"
description: "The entire test experience, from self-enrolling to performing the test, is designed to take under 5 minutes for new test takers to complete. Subsequent tests are much faster to perform, often taking only 1-2 minutes once the test taker has had practice."

## Starting a Test[​](#starting-a-test "Direct link to Starting a Test")

Test takers can either:

- Click on the self-enroll link provided.
- Scan the QR code with their mobile device.

## Registration Page[​](#registration-page "Direct link to Registration Page")

To register, the following fields must be completed:

- **Name**

After clicking the `Continue` button, a verification code emailed to the test taker.

![Verify Email Copy Number](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/email.png)

This code must be entered to continue.

![Verify Email Enter Number](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/enter-verify-code.png)

Next, the test taker selects their dominant hand.

A `Test Audio` button can be pressed (which plays a sound) to ensure audio levels are appropriate.

## Identity Verification[​](#identity-verification "Direct link to Identity Verification")

If face verification is required, the following must be provided:

- a photo id (government issued)
- a live face photo

Using the camera, the photo id should be aligned so that it is fully in view. The photo will be automatically taken.

![Take image of Photo Id](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/id-capture.png)

Next, using the front camera, a selfie will be taken to verify against the photo id.

![Take Photo](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/photo-capture.png)

Once verification is successful, a timed link is activated. If the test isn't started within the given timeframe or if the verification fails, verification will need to be restarted.

<Check>
  If verification fails, the ambient lighting. The photo id and face must be
  captured from a well-lit area. If problems persist, glasses and hats may need
  to be removed.
</Check>

<Note>
  Neurapulse never saves face or photo id information. Once verification is
  completed the image information is purged.
</Note>

## Task Loading[​](#task-loading "Direct link to Task Loading")

A brief loading screen appears while tasks are downloaded.

## Task Demonstration[​](#task-demonstration "Direct link to Task Demonstration")

Each task includes a step-by-step demonstration _with audio_. Test takers can navigate through instructions and start the task when ready.

![Reaction Time Task Demo](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/reaction-time-instructions.png)

## Performing Tasks[​](#performing-tasks "Direct link to Performing Tasks")

Tasks begin after the `Start` button is pressed.

![Start Button](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/trails-b-start.png)

Tasks are evaluated for a combination of speed and accuracy.

![Trails B Task](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/trails-b-task.png)

The test taker will be prompted with a `Continue` button between each task, to allow for brief rests.

![Continuation](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/continuation-screen.png)

## Test Completion[​](#test-completion "Direct link to Test Completion")

At the end of a test, the test taker may either see:

- A screen that says no further testing is required.

![Final Score Screen](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/final-score-screen-pass.png) ![Final Score Screen Alternative](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/final-score-screen-alldone.png)

- A screen that says the test taker must complete another test.

![Final Score Screen Alternative](/docs/Test-Taker-Experience/images/final-score-screen-retake.png)

<Warning>
  If the test taker is asked to complete another test, the test taker should
  immediately check their email for a new test link and complete it.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Safety statuses that are calibrated for the individual test taker are *only
  available to test managers* in the project portal. As data becomes available
  for an individual test taker, a status is determined from a calculation of
  risk that may combine objective, relative, and baseline perspectives.
