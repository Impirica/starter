## Device Unsupported[​](#device-unsupported "Direct link to Device Unsupported")

The test must be taken on a smartphone. If a message is shown that the device is unsupported, check to see that the smartphone is on the latest Android or iOS version.

* For Android devices: [Upgrade your operating system with these steps](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en).
* For iOS devices: [Upgrade your operating system with these steps](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/118575).

Older devices may not support the latest versions of Android or iOS. If this issue persists, the test should be completed on a different smartphone.

## Could Not Verify Identity[​](#could-not-verify-identity "Direct link to Could Not Verify Identity")

If the device does not have a modern front/back camera, it may not have the capability to perform identity verification. The test taker should contact their test manager directly to request a different testing device or ask to be exempted from testing until a supported device can be obtained.

## Browser Unsupported[​](#browser-unsupported "Direct link to Browser Unsupported")

Please ensure you are using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera or Samsung Internet for any testing. If you receive a message that your browser is unsupported, please check to see that you are on the latest version:

* For Android devices: [Update your browser with these steps](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412?hl=en)
* For iOS devices: [Update Safari through the iOS Settings app](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph98709f167/ios)

Older devices running older versions of Android or iOS may be unable to update your browser to a supported version. If this issue persists, please try the test on a different smartphone.

<Note>
  In-app browsers (like those in Facebook Messenger or other social media apps) are not supported. Please open the test link directly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera or Samsung Internet.

## Registration Error[​](#registration-error "Direct link to Registration Error")

If a test taker has already completed a test, they cannot self-enroll again. If attempted, the test taker will receive this error. Alternatively, if the test taker hasn't completed a test yet, the project used to generate the test link may not be running.
